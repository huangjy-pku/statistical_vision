# Statistical Vision

This is a repo for the course *Computer Vision: Statistical Models for Marr's Paradigm* in PKU, which is also known as [Stat 232A](http://www.stat.ucla.edu/~sczhu/Courses/UCLA/Stat_232A/Stat_232A.html) in UCLA. This repo contains the implementation of projects in the course, as well as some notes summarizing key ideas introduced in the course, which I will release later.
